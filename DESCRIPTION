Description: A technique for detecting anomalies in seasonal univariate time series.
   The methods uses are robust, from a statistical standpoint, in the presence of 
   seasonality and an underlying trend. These methods can be used in 
   wide variety of contexts. For example, detecting anomalies in system metrics after 
   a new software release, user engagement post an 'A/B' test, or for problems in 
   econometrics, financial engineering, political and social sciences.
